<h3>PROJECTS </h3>
<ol>
<li>Design and development of customized CP chairs for a 3 year old child. </li>
<ul>
<li>The CP chair was designed using finite element analysis to ensure its structural integrity, safety, and durability. This analysis helped in identifying and addressing potential weak points, ensuring that the chair can safely support the child's weight and movements.</li>
<li>The design process also focused on cost optimization, selecting materials and manufacturing processes that balance affordability with quality. This approach ensures that the chair is accessible to a wider range of families with children with cerebral palsy, making it more feasible for them to acquire.</li>
<li>The chair features adjustable components such as the backrest, headrest, body support strap, and footrest. These adjustable features allow the chair to be customized to the child's specific needs, providing ergonomic comfort and promoting correct posture, which is crucial for children with cerebral palsy.</li>
</ul>
<li>
    <h3>Adaptive mouse for people with upper limb impairments</h3></li>
<ul>
 <li>The adaptive mouse for individuals with upper limb impairments is engineered to offer a user-friendly option for computer interaction. </li>
<li>This device is intricately crafted to address diverse dexterity and mobility levels, ensuring its usability for those with restricted hand movements or strength.</li>
<li>The mouse incorporates cutting-edge sensor technology to track movement accurately</li>
</ul>
<li>
<h3>Numerical Investigation on the Acoustic Properties of Porous Absorbers - A comparative study</h3> </li>

<p>Sound absorption characteristics of some of the commonly available natural materials like kenaf, hemp, coconut, cork, wood, sheep wool, chicken feather etc. and synthetic materials like glass wool and polyurethane are numerically investigated. Numerical simulations using COMSOL were carried out on absorbers of natural fibers that exhibited good acoustic absorption at medium and high frequencies, similar to that of traditional porous materials. Incorporation of natural fibers along with synthetic fibers enhanced the sound absorption, particularly in the lower frequency.</p> 

<li>
    <h3>Fabrication and investigation of Mechanical Properties of a Jute Fiber Reinforced polyester Composite </h3></li>

        <p>Tested the mechanical properties like tensile strength, flexural strength, impact properties and water absorption property. </p>
